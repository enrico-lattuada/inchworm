          This pull request was automatically created because the merge from \`main\` into \`develop\` resulted in conflicts that require manual resolution.

          ### What happened?
          A hotfix or change was merged directly into \`main\`, and now \`develop\` needs to be updated to include those changes. However, there are conflicting changes between the branches.

          ### What to do?
          1. Check out this PR locally
          2. Resolve the merge conflicts
          3. Push the resolved changes
          4. Merge this PR

          cc @${{ github.repository_owner }}"
            echo "Created new PR for manual merge"
          else
            echo "PR #$EXISTING_PR already exists for this merge"
